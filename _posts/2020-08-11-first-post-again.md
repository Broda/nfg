This is the first post of a new static site built with jekyll! I'm tired of CMS bloat and spam. I'm going to set this site up with GitHub Pages and let it be. I have no delusions that I will update it regularly. I've restarted this site so many times over the years with grand plans and I'm just tired of doing that -- even as I do it again now...

So far, jekyll is pretty cool and markdown is interesting -- though limiting, which may be a good thing. Here's to another new beginning. I will post here when I feel like it but no promises :)
